      "full": "Grey aliens, or \\\"Greys,\\\" represent the most iconic and widely reported type of alleged extraterrestrial entity in modern UFO literature. Described as short humanoid beings standing 3-4 feet tall (with occasional taller variants), they are characterized by: The Grey archetype emerged in UFO literature during the 1950s-60s but achieved cultural ubiquity following the **Betty and Barney Hill abduction case (1961)** and exploded into public consciousness with **Whitley Strieber's bestselling book \\\"Communion\\\" (1987)** and its haunting cover image. Greys are most commonly associated with **abduction scenarios** involving medical examinations, reproductive procedures, telepathic communication, and emotionless clinical behavior. The phenomenon peaked in the 1980s-1990s and has declined in the 2000s, though reports continue."
