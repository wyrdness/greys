      "summary": "Classic 'grey alien' archetype - short humanoids with large bulbous heads, huge black almond-shaped eyes, grey or pale skin. Most commonly reported alien type in abduction scenarios, popularized by the Betty and Barney Hill case (1961) and Whitley Strieber's 'Communion' (1987).",
      "full": "Grey aliens, or 'Greys,' represent the most iconic and widely reported type of alleged extraterrestrial entity. Described as short humanoid beings standing 3-4 feet tall (with some variants reported at 5-6 feet), they are characterized by disproportionately large, bulbous heads, enormous black almond-shaped eyes that dominate their facial features, minimal nose and mouth structures, thin frail bodies, long arms, and grey or pale white skin. Greys emerged in UFO literature in the 1950s-60s but achieved cultural ubiquity following the 1961 Betty and Barney Hill abduction case and exploded into public consciousness with Whitley Strieber's 1987 book 'Communion' and its haunting cover image. Greys are most commonly associated with abduction scenarios involving medical examinations, reproductive procedures, telepathic communication, and emotionless behavior. While proponents claim Greys represent genuine extraterrestrial visitors (often said to originate from Zeta Reticuli), skeptics attribute the phenomenon to sleep paralysis hallucinations, false memories, cultural contamination, and psychological factors. The Grey has become the archetypal alien in popular culture, appearing in countless films, television shows, and media."
